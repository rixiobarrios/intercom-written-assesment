            <h2>1. Describe a coding solution that you were most proud of. This could be a small problem that you solved smartly, or a larger problem that you had to break down into pieces. Please include the details on the specific scenario, the blockers you came up against, and your specific technical efforts to build the solution.</br></h2>
            <p>
                Answer:I built a cocktail app where you can search for alcoholic drinks and how to make them. 
                I used React, React Router and a third party API.
            The app was pretty interesting to get working off such a poorly built API; However I took the challenge
            head on, had issues rendering the data while ignoring null values. I searched far and wide, worked a few
            variables, got help from my instructors until I forged the solution. I learned that most time you have
            to work with a third party API, you have to build your app around it no matter how low its quality and documentation are.</p>
            <p>It was interesting to see how this data needed to be told how to handle every output it had with code and logic.</p>
            <p>My solution required a bit of learning, quick thinking and clever coding which made me really proud</p>
            <p>In the future I plan to approach this code by analyzing the data structure better, sudo-coding and planning my approach carefully</p>

            <h2>2. Troubleshooting - You've been chatting with a user who is writing code to interact with our API, but they are getting HTTP 504 status code errors and they've requested assistance. How do you help them identify the root cause and work through the errors? What kind of information would you gather from them, and how would you use that to help solve the issue?</br></h2>
            <p>Answer: It's important to understand that a 504 error refers to a gateway error while attempting to load a page which response from the server was not timed out. This occurs when an intermediary server or a network interface cannot respond to a browser's query within a suficcient time. The error can originate on the customer side or on the side of the provider/operator. 
                We can start troubleshooting the issue on the user side by asking them to reload the desired web application or try to access it from another device in their network. The next step would be to have the user restart their modem, router and/or switch. This is unusual but a defective configuration on a proxy server might be generating issues. 
                A quick review at the setting on the user's browser might show the problem. The user DNS server might be the issue, trying another DNS server might solve the problem. Ultimately, if all fails I would start looking on our side for possible service outtages or updates that may cause settings to change or go down. 
                If this is the case I would offer my apologies and give the user an aproximate time for the fix based on feedback from the team in charge of such a function.
