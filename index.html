            <h2>1. Describe a coding solution that you were most proud of. This could be a small problem that you solved smartly, or a larger problem that you had to break down into pieces. Please include the details on the specific scenario, the blockers you came up against, and your specific technical efforts to build the solution.</br></h2>
            <p>
                Answer:I built a cocktail app where you can search for alcoholic
drinks and how to make them. I used React, React Router and a third
party API.  The app got pretty interesting as I was working off such a poorly built
API.  However I took the challenge head on but had issues rendering the
data while ignoring null values. I searched far and wide.  I even worked a few
variables and got help from my instructors until I forged the solution.
Knowing that most times you have to work with a third party API, you
have to build your app around it no matter how low its quality and
documentation are. It was interesting to see how this data needed to
be told how to handle every output it had with code and logic. My
solution required a bit of learning, quick thinking and clever coding
which made me really proud of myself and my work. In the future, I plan to approach this code
by analyzing the data structure better, planning my
approach more carefully and pseudo coding.</p>

            <h2>2. Troubleshooting - You've been chatting with a user who is writing code to interact with our API, but they are getting HTTP 504 status code errors and they've requested assistance. How do you help them identify the root cause and work through the errors? What kind of information would you gather from them, and how would you use that to help solve the issue?</br></h2>
            <p>Answer: It is important to understand that a 504 error refers to a
gateway error while attempting to load a page whose response from the
server was not timed out. This occurs when an intermediary server or a
network interface cannot respond to a browser's query within a
sufficient time. The error can originate on the customer side or on
the side of the provider/operator. We can start troubleshooting the
issue on the user side by asking them to reload the desired web
application or try to access it from another device in their network.
The next step would be to have the user restart their modem, router
and/or switch. This is unusual but a defective configuration on a
proxy server might be generating issues. A quick review of the setting
on the user's browser might show the problem. The user DNS server
might be the issue.  Perhaps trying another DNS server might solve the problem.
Ultimately, if all of these fail, I would start looking on our side for
possible service outages or updates that may cause settings to change
or go down.  If this is the case, I would offer my apologies and give the user an
approximate time for the fix based on feedback from the team in charge
of such a function.

            <p>Answer: I am not familiar with Ruby but I understand it's pretty similar to Javascript so I took that approach and came up with this fix. I deleted the recursive call.</p>

            <h2>4. Can you give us an example of when youâ€™ve helped a customer solve their actual problem, rather than treating the symptom? This could be a time where you had to figure out what the customer's actual goal was, even if it wasn't clear from their original question or problem.</br></h2>
            <p>Answer: While I was working as a help desk support agent for Fifth Third Bank,
I had a teller that had problems printing a receipt for her customer.
The teller thought it was an issue with the computer or the printer.
She had already started her computer and printer but the issue
remained. Luckily, I had the ability to get into her workstation
remotely. My first instinct was to look at the proprietary software
that they use to look up a customer's account. I looked at the
settings and realized that her problem did not originate in the
computer or printer. The settings for the Fifth Third Bank customer portal
were defaulting to her regular printer and not the receipt printer.
I also realized this was a known bug in the previous version of the
portal, so I sent a remote request to all tellers to let me into their
machine remotely and update their software. Once the branch updated
their software, I set up their configurations to their receipt
printers and solved the issue location wide.</p>
            <h2>5. Tell us about a time where you didn't know what to do next, or how to solve a challenging problem. Explain the scenario, how you decided on what was needed, how you prioritized it, and the final outcome.</br></h2>
            <p>Answer:  As a diplomat I encountered a situation with a national who
was a minor and was being detained by the US authorities. This was
the first case of its kind that I have encountered so my first instinct was 
to find the international code referring to
unaccompanied minors and their rights in foreign countries. I then
followed this by reading about our role as a consulate and finally I
researched the role of our ministry dealing with interior relations. The objective
was to find a legal vehicle to manage the situation appropriately.
Armed with all the knowledge of the legal framework I was allowed to
act upon, I proceeded to make a report for my supervisor back in our
country detailing the situation and what our various courses of action
could be based on the current legal framework. I awaited their orders
to proceed.  In the meantime, I proceeded to notify the family of the
child about the situation. I was instructed to visit the child,
provide comfort, and serve as a bridge for the child and his family to
communicate. After exercising our rights concerning the child, we proceeded to take the child back to our country and reunited him with his
family.</p>
