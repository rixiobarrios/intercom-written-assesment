            <h2>1. Describe a coding solution that you were most proud of. This could be a small problem that you solved smartly, or a larger problem that you had to break down into pieces. Please include the details on the specific scenario, the blockers you came up against, and your specific technical efforts to build the solution.</br></h2>
            <p>
                Answer:I built a cocktail app where you can search for alcoholic drinks and how to make them. I used
            React, React Router and a third party API.
            The app was pretty interesting to get working off such a poorly built API; However I took the challenge
            head on, had issues rendering the data while ignoring null values. I searched far and wide, worked a few
            variables, got help from my instructors until I forged the solution. I learned that most time you have
            to work with a third party API, you have to build your app around it no matter how low its quality and documentation are.</p>
            <p>It was interesting to see how this data needed to be told how to handle every output it had with code and logic.</p>
            <p>My solution required a bit of learning, quick thinking and clever coding which made me really proud</p>
            <p>In the future I plan to approach this code by analyzing the data structure better, sudo-coding and planning my approach carefully</p>
